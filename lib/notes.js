//TODO: Exports a constructor function.

//TODO: Create a prototype method called execute() that executes the correct operation, given the above object (reference --> {action: "add", payload: "user's note"})
// Use that object to run the correct method; we can predict that "add" won’t be the only action we’re going to have to handle!

//TODO: Write a prototype method called add() that will create an object representing a note (with an ID and the note text as properties)

//TODO: Console.log the text of the note to be added when the add command is executed.
